# A newly discovered role of evolution in previously published consumer–resource dynamics

The Authors of this paper developed a statistical method to probe for a transition from classical to eco-evolutionary cycles in consumer-resource cycles.

Classic ecological consumer-resource models often produce cyclical dynamics, where the consumerabundance lags behind the resource by ¼ of the period.There are however few published examples of experimental systems showing this pattern.
 
In this study, the authors reveal that many observed and published consumer-resource dynamics show instead patterns indicating eco-evolutionary dynamics.Theoretically, if prey evolve along a trade-off between defence and competitive ability, two-species consumer-resource cycles become longer and antiphase(half-period lag, so consumer maxima coincide with minima of the resource species).
Such antiphase patterns of eco-evolutionary cycles take time to emerge, as prey must evolve to a defended state.The authors applied thir analysis to 21 two-species consumer-resource time series, published between 1934 and 1997.They aimed to statistically identify a transition from ecological dynamics at initial point of experiment (¼ lag as ), to eco-evolutionary cycles.
