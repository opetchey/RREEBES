Eric Ward kindly provided the raw data, processed data and R scripts to re-run the forecasting analyses in a dedicated [github repository](https://github.com/eric-ward/complexity-costly). So far, only the fish time-series are publicly available, but that's good enough to get us started with reproducing the results and learn the techniques.

The raw data, processed data and R scripts are in the respective article folder.
