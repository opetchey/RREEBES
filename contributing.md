Guidelines for contributing
===========================

We invite you to contribute to the reproductions, and to make suggestions of papers to reproduce. You may like to contact the maintainer, currently Owen Petchey, before making contriubutions, though this is not necesssary.

Make contributions by one of these methods:

1. Create an Issue (the simpler option). For this you need to have a github account and to follow the [guidelines about creating issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
2. Use a pull request (the more involved option). See here for more information on [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

(Pull requests are preferable.)

Both are described here: [Contributing to a Project](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing)
